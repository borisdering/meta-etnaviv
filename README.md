# meta-etnaviv

meta-etnaviv is a layer for yocto to build accelerated graphics for
embedded Linux systems with a Vivante graphics chipset.

Both the etnaviv driver stack and this yocto layer are works in progress.
Use at your own risk, and if you find a bug with this layer, please let me
know, and ideally send a pull request.

To be clear, this etnaviv layer attempts to use the mainline kernel
and most recent developer repositories. It makes no attempt to support
any Vivante provided drivers or libraries.
